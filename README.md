Design and implement a microprocessor-based, digital, device-control interface that allows operators to individually turn on and off devices by entering a passcode.

This project is to demonstrate skills in mapping a provided circuit diagram to a breadboard in a simulation environment.

First, categorize the digital pins as inputs and outputs by analyzing the project requirements and the provided diagram. Then, with justifications, determine when to use interrupts and polling. Finally,design and implement the MicroPython code to drive multiplexers, convert binary numbers and enable the passcode functionality.
